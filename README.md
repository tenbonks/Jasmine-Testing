#Jasmine Practice

Check out the documentation of jasmine here. https://jasmine.github.io/

Best place to source Jasmine to your project is via "CDN", for Jasmine to work you want Jasmine.js, jasmine-html.js, boot.js and jasmine.css, they need to be loaded in that order. to get the correct tags click the drop down and copy either "script tag" or "link tag".

It's good practice when testing, to create a folder for spec and scripts, spec being short for specification, we can use this folder for any scripts that will be testing our code in the script folder.

Always develop test incrementally, make your test's fail first, this means the test actually works, it's no good having  a test that always results in a pass. use the red-green refactor to make sure everything is working and passing tests PROPERLY.
